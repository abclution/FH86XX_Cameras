# FH86XX_Cameras
All I know about these low cost cameras. 

This repo applies to those specific cameras. 

It may work with other similar cameras, but be aware there are a lot of very similar looking cameras, and not all of them are FH86XX based.

In fact I have a couple of other nearly identical looking devices that are possibly A9 variants, and they are not remotely similar in terms of the underlying hardware.

First,  a little background information.

I picked up a couple of low cost  FH8616  based "Inteligent Cameras" 

You can find these for not much on AliExpress, with a search string of something like..

8MP Wifi IP Outdoor Wireless Security Surveillance PTZ Camera 4X Zoom Cameras AI Human Tracking Two-way Audio HD Night Color Cam

This is a bit of a stretch since the camera sensor in the one I am looking at currently is a 2MP sensor, but what the heck do you expect for the price. 

It also claims IP66 waterproof rating, but this would only apply if you put it under an umbrella, in the middle of the Sahara. 

The model I have has firware FH8616_IPC_V1.0.0_20230815 on it, but I suspect there are dozens of variants. 

On the plus side, it does "AI" motion detection, and has two motor axis control, and a pair of probably fake wifi antennae. 
.. oh and some very bright LEDs, and some IR LEDs too.. not bad for a few bucks.

Here on the wiki is a root exploit that should get you telnet root access. 

There are a few other related scripts in the repo. Feel free to download and try them. Some, all or none of them may work with your camera.
